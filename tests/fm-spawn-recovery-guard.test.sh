# Regression test for the fm-spawn.sh recovery-relaunch ownership guard
# (bin/fm-spawn.sh, resolve_recorded_task_worktree and the worktree-entry
# branch after it).
#
# A ship/scout spawn for a task id that already has state/<id>.meta is a
# relaunch of an interrupted task. Before the guard it ran the fresh-allocation
# path unchanged: `treehouse get` handed out ANOTHER worktree and the meta write
# truncated the record, so the recorded worktree - holding uncommitted edits and
# unpushed commits - was left with no durable owner, and a still-live recorded
# agent would have meant two workers on one task identity. The backends' own
# duplicate refusals never covered it: tmux only refuses while the task WINDOW
# still exists, which is exactly what an interrupted task no longer has.
#
# These cases pin the fixed behavior: a provable relaunch re-enters the recorded
# worktree without asking treehouse for a new one, an unprovable one refuses with
# every record and worktree intact, and a task id with no record still takes the
# unchanged fresh-allocation path.
